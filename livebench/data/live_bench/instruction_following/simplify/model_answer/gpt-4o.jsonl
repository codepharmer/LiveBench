This has led to calls for the regulator to stop these companies from making customers pay for this old and unreliable method. Ofwat, the regulator, said companies that don't meet their promises to customers could face fines. Water dowsers, also known as water witchers, use rods that supposedly cross over when they detect water underground, but studies have shown this method is no better than guessing. Despite this, some water companies claim it can be as effective as modern technology. A science blogger named Sally Le Page discovered that companies were still using water dowsing after her parents saw an engineer from Severn Trent using bent tent pegs to find a pipe. When she asked Severn Trent why they were using this method, they replied on Twitter saying they found old methods just as effective as new ones, but they also use drones and satellites.

It gives a brief description of what each show is about and what viewers can expect to see. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each show mentioned:\n\n### Blue Planet II (8pm, BBC One)\n\nThis is a nature documentary series that showcases the beauty of underwater life. In this episode, viewers will explore underwater forests made of kelp, algae, and seagrass. The show features some fascinating and sometimes creepy sea creatures. For example, there\u2019s a sea cucumber with ten arms that eats starfish eggs, which might remind you of the scary creature from the movie \"Return of the Jedi.\" But it\u2019s not all scary; there are also calming scenes, like a Garibaldi damselfish protecting its home from sea urchins and a cuttlefish with an interesting way of finding a mate.\n\n### Howards End (9pm, BBC One)\n\nThis is a drama series based on a classic novel. Hayley Atwell plays Margaret, who gets a marriage proposal from Henry, played by Matthew Macfadyen. Just as they start planning their future together, someone from Henry\u2019s past shows up and causes trouble. Henry doesn\u2019t handle the situation well, which creates tension between their families. Another character, Leonard Bast, is also facing difficulties. He followed some advice to change jobs but now finds himself poor and hungry.\n\n### Expedition Volcano (9pm, BBC Two)\n\nThis is a science documentary where Chris Jackson, Xand Van Tulleken, and Aldo Kane travel to the Congo. They join a team of scientists who are studying Mount Nyiragongo, one of the world\u2019s most impressive active volcanoes. The scientists set up a camp near the volcano to conduct their research. They face various dangers, such as the possibility of lava flowing into their camp and the risks of getting sick or suffocating from the volcanic gases. It\u2019s a very adventurous and risky mission.\n\n### Guy Martin vs the Robot Car (9pm, Channel 4)\n\nThis show features Guy Martin, who is known for his love of racing and mechanics. He faces a new challenge as he races against an autonomous, or self-driving, racing car called the Roboracer. This is significant because self-driving cars represent a major change in the automotive world, and Guy\u2019s career is based on traditional car racing. The show explores how he deals with this technological advancement.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, the text provides a snapshot of four different TV programs airing on the same night. Each show offers something unique: a stunning nature documentary, a dramatic period piece, an adventurous scientific expedition, and a thrilling race between a man and a robot car. The descriptions aim to entice viewers by highlighting the most interesting aspects of each program."]}], "tstamp": 1726432029.712748}

This number surpasses the 931,000 copies sold by Ed Sheeran's album '\u00f7' (Divide) since its release in early March. Swift has strategically kept most of the songs from 'Reputation' off streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, which means fans have to buy the album either by downloading it or purchasing a physical CD to listen to it. Additionally, she implemented a controversial promotion where fans who bought multiple copies of the album had a better chance of getting tickets to her upcoming tour, which further boosted sales. According to Nielsen, the organization that tracks album sales in the US, 'Reputation' sold more copies than the combined total of the rest of the top 200 albums. Swift's last three albums also sold over a million copies in their first week in the US, which is becoming increasingly difficult as fewer people buy downloads and CDs. Her record label, Big Machine, reported that an additional 905,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 84,000 of those in the UK. This makes 'Reputation' the sixth highest first-week seller in the UK this year, behind albums by Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag'N'Bone Man, and Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of '\u00f7' in its first week. Despite these impressive numbers, Swift's US sales are still far from the all-time record set by Adele in 2015, when her album '25' sold 3.37 million copies in its first week. Forbes has also estimated that Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017, dropping from the top spot last year when her earnings were boosted by her '1989' tour. This year, she is estimated to have earned $44 million (\u00a333 million), which is less than Beyonc\u00e9, who earned $105 million (\u00a379 million) from her Formation world tour, and Adele, who earned $69 million (\u00a352 million).\""]}], "tstamp": 1726431991.8236315}

For example, drinking spirits like vodka or whiskey can make people feel energetic, confident, and sexy, but it can also make them angry or sad. On the other hand, red wine usually makes people feel relaxed but can also make them tired. This study, which is like a new chapter in understanding alcohol's effects, involved almost 30,000 people from 21 countries. They answered questions about how different drinks made them feel. The researchers suspect that these emotional responses to alcohol are complex and hope that people will think carefully about what they drink. It's an important thing to consider for public health. This study gives people the freedom to make more informed choices about alcohol, rather than just focusing on physical health issues like cancer or liver disease.

This was a big deal because, at the start of the 17th century, English was growing and changing rapidly. A major milestone in this development was the publication of the First Folio, a collection of Shakespeare's plays.\n\nShakespeare himself didn't bother to publish his plays during his lifetime. It wasn't until seven years after his death, in 1623, that a bookseller named Edward Blount finally got his hands on this important collection called \"Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories & Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies.\" This book is now known as the First Folio.\n\nThe First Folio is incredibly important for two main reasons. First, it includes 36 of Shakespeare's plays, 18 of which had never been published before. Without this book, famous plays like \"Macbeth,\" \"Julius Caesar,\" and \"The Tempest\" might have been lost forever. This collection also introduced many new words to the English language, like \"catastrophe,\" \"exaggerate,\" and \"assassinate.\"\n\nSecond, the First Folio connects Shakespeare to his time by including praises from his contemporary, Ben Jonson, and featuring a famous portrait of Shakespeare. This helped establish Shakespeare's lasting fame. Today, the First Folio is extremely valuable, worth over $5 million, and only about 240 copies exist worldwide."]}], "tstamp": 1726431970.6537774}

The plant is expected to cost billpayers \u00a330bn over 35 years, adding \u00a310-\u00a315 to the average household energy bill. The committee found that no one in the government was looking out for consumers during talks with the French company EDF Energy. The final cost to consumers increased because the government didn't renegotiate the price, fearing EDF and its Chinese partner CGN would abandon the project. The agreed price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour in 2013 became much more expensive by 2016 due to falling fossil fuel prices, raising the cost to consumers from \u00a36bn to \u00a330bn.

Meg Hillier, the committee chair, said the government gave billpayers a bad deal.\n\nThe committee's criticism follows a harsh report by the UK's spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), which said the Hinkley contract locked consumers into a risky and expensive project.

This is a director who deals in feelings. To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s Hetty Feather was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part Jane Eyre, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen \u2013 possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre. It\u2019s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre\u2019s Olivier stage for Christmas \u2013 arguably the biggest family slot of the year \u2013 to put on Peter Pan. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott\u2019s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds.

She was in her 50s when her production of \"Hetty Feather\" was nominated for a prestigious Olivier award in 2015. Her notable work includes a two-part adaptation of \"Jane Eyre,\" which combines movement, music, color, and light. This production has been seen by over 250,000 people since its debut in 2014. Due to her success, she was given the prime Christmas slot at the National Theatre to stage \"Peter Pan\" last year.
