He believes that several teachers were absent when he needed them, which affected his education.

Siddiqui argues that if he had received a better degree, he would have become an international commercial lawyer.\n\nSECTION 2  \nHe also mentions that his mental health has worsened due to this situation, leading to clinical depression and insomnia. The legal dispute between Siddiqui and Oxford has been going on for over a year. Last year, a judge allowed Siddiqui to continue with his case after Oxford argued that it was not valid and was filed too late. The judge decided that Siddiqui might have a good chance of winning or that it would be fair for the case to proceed.

The company responded on Twitter, saying that some older methods can be just as good as newer ones, but they also use drones and satellites.\n\nLe Page then asked the other eleven water companies if they used dowsing.

This figure surpasses the 931,000 copies sold by Ed Sheeran's album *\u00f7* (pronounced 'divide'), which was released earlier in March. One of the reasons for Swift's high sales is that she has chosen to keep most of the songs from *Reputation* off popular streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. This means that fans who want to listen to her new music must either purchase it as a digital download or buy a physical CD. Additionally, Swift has introduced a somewhat controversial marketing strategy where fans who buy multiple copies of the album have a better chance of securing tickets to her upcoming concert tour. This promotion has likely contributed to the surge in album sales. According to Nielsen, a company that tracks album sales in the US, *Reputation* sold more copies than all of the other top 200 albums combined during that week, highlighting its extraordinary popularity. Swift's previous three albums also achieved the milestone of selling over a million copies in their first week, a significant accomplishment that is becoming harder to achieve as fewer people are buying physical albums or digital downloads. \n\nFurthermore, her record label, Big Machine, reported that *Reputation* sold an additional 905,000 copies worldwide, with 84,000 of those sales occurring in the UK. This sales figure places *Reputation* as the sixth-largest first-week album sales in the UK for the year, trailing behind albums from artists like Sam Smith, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Rag\u2019N\u2019Bone Man, and Ed Sheeran, who sold 671,000 copies of his album *\u00f7* in its first week. While Swift's sales in the US are impressive, they still fall short of the all-time record for first-week sales, which is held by Adele. In 2015, Adele's album *25* sold a staggering 3.37 million copies in its opening week, a benchmark that remains unmatched. \n\nIn addition to her album's sales success, Forbes has estimated that Taylor Swift is the third highest-earning female musician in 2017. This is a drop from her previous position as the highest earner the year before, when her earnings were significantly boosted by the revenue generated from her concert tour for her earlier album, *1989*. This year, Swift is estimated to have earned $44 million, which is approximately \u00a333 million. However, she is behind Beyonc\u00e9, who earned $105 million (\u00a379 million) thanks to her Formation world tour, and Adele, who made $69 million (\u00a352 million). This financial ranking reflects not just album sales but also the impact of concert tours and other revenue streams in the music industry. Overall, Taylor Swift's *Reputation* has made a significant mark on the music charts, showcasing her ability to connect with fans and drive album sales in a challenging market.\""]}], "tstamp": 1726739123.1247716}

Now researchers say the emotions people feel when drinking could be linked to their tipple of choice. An international survey has revealed that spirits are often associated with feelings of energy, confidence and sexiness \u2013 but on the flip-side anger and tearfulness \u2013 while red wine is the drink most commonly linked to relaxation, but also tiredness. While the researchers say the reasons for the links are likely to be complex, they hope the study will urge individuals to think carefully about the alcohol they consume. \u201cFrom a public health perspective a lot of the time we have focused on issues around cancer, heart disease and liver disease \u2013 but an important aspect is the balance of emotional outcomes that people are getting from alcohol,\u201d said Mark Bellis, co-author of the research from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, is based on an anonymous online questionnaire that was completed by individuals aged between 18 and 34 who had drunk alcohol in the previous year. Part of an international survey on alcohol and drug use, the questions probed the type of alcohol drunk and associated emotions, and were asked in 11 different languages, with participants taking part from 21 countries around the world. The results, based on answers from almost 30,000 participants who had reported consuming both red and white wine as well as beer and spirits in the past year, reveal that certain types of alcoholic drink appear to be linked to particular emotions. Almost 53% of participants said drinking red wine made them feel relaxed \u2013 an emotion that was also linked to beer by nearly 50% of participants, and white wine by nearly 33%. By contrast, spirits were linked to feelings of confidence by just over 59% of participants, energy by more than 58% and sexiness by just over 42%.  \n-------  \nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

For some, drinking can be fun and joyful, like a chapter in a happy story, while for others, it can lead to sadness, like a tearful journey. Researchers found that people often feel energized, confident, or sexy when they drink spirits, but they might also feel angry or sad. On the other hand, red wine is mostly linked to feeling relaxed, but it can also make people feel tired.

Her shows, for all their simplicity, can be hard to pin down, but her words are telling: \u201cI\u2019m always looking for the heart of a story,\u201d she says. This is a director who deals in feelings. To those not paying attention, Cookson landed like a bolt from the blue. Most directors cut through in their 30s, but she was in her 50s when her circus-heavy staging of Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s Hetty Feather was nominated for an Olivier award in 2015. Her calling card, however, was a magnificent, two-part Jane Eyre, a total theatre treat that translated Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s book into movement and music, colour and light. Since its premiere at the Bristol Old Vic in 2014, more than 250,000 people have seen it on stage or on screen \u2013 possibly unprecedented for a piece of devised theatre. It\u2019s why, last year, Cookson got the National Theatre\u2019s Olivier stage for Christmas \u2013 arguably the biggest family slot of the year \u2013 to put on Peter Pan. This year, as a mark of her newfound bankability, Marianne Elliott\u2019s new commercial company has backed her to bring Narnia to life in Leeds. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has even boosted its capacity for the purpose, transforming its 750-seat amphitheatre into a vast, 1,000-plus theatre in the round.  \n-------  \nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.  \n\nSally Cookson, a theater director, feels uncomfortable talking about her work. She focuses on finding the main emotional part of a story. Although many directors become successful in their 30s, Cookson gained recognition in her 50s when her show \"Hetty Feather\" was nominated for an award in 2015. Her most famous work is a two-part adaptation of \"Jane Eyre,\" which combines movement, music, and colors. Since it first showed in 2014, over 250,000 people have watched it, which is unusual for this type of theater. Last year, she was given a chance to direct \"Peter Pan\" at a major theater during Christmas, which is a popular time for family shows. This year, a new company is supporting her to create a production of \"Narnia\" in Leeds, and the theater is expanding to accommodate more audience members."]}], "tstamp": 1726739195.8434818}
