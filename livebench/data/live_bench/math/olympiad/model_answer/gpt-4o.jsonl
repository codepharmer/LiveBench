The only viable option here is <expression 1> $d_i$ or <expression 8> $d_i$.\n\n2. **Second Sentence:**\n   - \"It is clear that each $d_i$ must be $p$, so each row represents a single residue <missing 3>.\"\n   - Here, <missing 3> should be a modulus, which is <expression 6> $\\pmod{p}$ or <expression 7> $\\pmod{p}$.\n\n3. **Third Sentence:**\n   - \"Thus, we can rearrange the grid so that column $i$ contains all consecutive numbers from <missing 4> to $ip$, which works.\"\n   - For <missing 4>, we need a starting number for the range. The only relevant formula is <expression 9> $1 + (i-1)p$.\n\n4. **Fourth Sentence:**\n   - \"If <missing 5>, then $p$ always divides <missing 6>.\"\n   - This is similar to the first sentence, so <missing 5> and <missing 6> should follow the same logic as <missing 1> and <missing 2>.\n\n5. **Fifth Sentence:**\n   - \"It is clear that each <missing 7> must be $p$, so each row represents a single residue <missing 8>.\"\n   - This is similar to the second sentence, so <missing 7> and <missing 8> should follow the same logic as <missing 3>.\n\n6. **Sixth Sentence:**\n   - \"Thus, we can rearrange the grid so that column $i$ contains all consecutive numbers from <missing 9> to $ip$, which works.\"\n   - This is similar to the third sentence, so <missing 9> should follow the same logic as <missing 4>.\n\n### Proof Section\n\n7. **First Sentence:**\n   - \"Let <missing 10>. Look at the term <missing 11>; we claim it cannot be part of a column that has cells forming an arithmetic sequence after any appropriate rearranging.\"\n   - For <missing 10>, we need a definition involving $a$ and $b$, which is <expression 12> $n = ab$.\n   - For <missing 11>, we need a term involving $a$ and $b$, which is <expression 10> $a^2b + ab$.\n\n8. **Second Sentence:**\n   - \"After such a rearrangement, if the column it is in has common difference <missing 12>, then $a^2b + ab - d$ must also be in its column, which is impossible.\"\n   - For <missing 12>, we need a common difference, which is <expression 13> $d = ab = n$.\n\n9. **Third Sentence:**\n   - \"If the column has difference $d > ab = n$, then no element in the next row can be in its column.\"\n   - This sentence doesn't have a missing part.\n\n10. **Fourth Sentence:**\n    - \"If the common difference is <missing 13>, then <missing 14> and $a^2b + ab - d = a^2b$, which are both in the row above it, must both be in the same column, which is impossible.\"\n    - For <missing 13>, we need a common difference, which is <expression 13> $d = ab = n$.\n    - For <missing 14>, we need a term involving $a$ and $b$, which is <expression 4> $a^2b + ab - 2d = a^2b - ab$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the reasoning above, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: 3, 1, 6, 9, 3, 1, 1, 6, 9, 12, 10, 13, 13, 4"]}], "tstamp": 1726434022.3077755}

This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position \\( P \\), Alice added \\( a \\) to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position \\( P \\), Alice will add \\( a \\) to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state \\( P \\) of the board. If at least one number \\( n \\) on the board is even, Alice can add \\( a \\) to a number other than \\( n \\), meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state \\( P \\) of the board. This covers all possible boards when \\( v_2(a) = 0 \\), so we're done.\n\nHere, the missing formula is \\( v_2(a) = 0 \\), which is <expression 9>.\n\n### Case 2: \\( v_2(a) = 1 \\)\n- If there is at least one number \\( n \\) on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add \\( a \\) to this number \\( n \\) if and only if \\( v_2(n) = 1 \\). This way, the new number \\( n' = n + a \\) satisfies \\( v_2(n') \\geq 2 \\). If Bob does divide \\( n' \\) until \\( v_2(n) = 1 \\), Alice will again add \\( a \\) to \\( n \\) resulting in \\( n' = n + a \\). This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nHere, the missing formulae are:\n- \\( v_2(n) = 1 \\), which is <expression 6>.\n- \\( n' = n + a \\), which is <expression 2>.\n- \\( v_2(n') \\geq 2 \\), which is <expression 4>.\n- \\( n' \\), which is <expression 1>.\n- \\( n' = n + a \\), which is <expression 2>.\n\n### General Case: \\( v_2(a) = x \\)\n- Alice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add \\( a \\) to \\( n \\) if and only if \\( v_2(n) = v_2(a) \\). If she does this addition, then \\( v_2(n') \\geq v_2(a) + 1 \\), keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides \\( n' \\) until \\( v_2(n) = v_2(a) \\), Alice will apply the same strategy and keep \\( v_2(n') \\geq v_2(a) + 1 \\). Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number \\( n \\) on the board such that \\( v_2(n) \\geq v_2(a) \\), ensuring there always exists an even number \\( n \\) on the board.\n\nHere, the missing formulae are:\n- \\( n' \\), which is <expression 1>.\n- \\( v_2(n) = v_2(a) \\), which is <expression 7>.\n\n### Conclusion\n- If \\( v_2(n) < v_2(a) \\) for all \\( n \\) on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of \\( v_2(n) \\) for any \\( n \\) on the board.

This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$, Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$, Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number $n$ on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$, meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when **<missing 2>**, so we're done.\n\n   - **<missing 1>**: This is the scenario where the game lasts forever. This seems to be a general statement about the game lasting indefinitely. \n   - **<missing 2>**: This must be a condition related to the evenness of numbers on the board. \n\n### Case 2 Analysis:\n2. **<missing 3>**: If there is at least one number $n$ on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if $v_2(n)=1$. This way, the new number $n' = n + a$ satisfies **<missing 4>**. If Bob divides $n'$ until **<missing 5>**, Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in **<missing 6>**. This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\n   - **<missing 3>**: This is the scenario where there is at least one even number on the board. \n   - **<missing 4>**: This must be a condition on $n'$ after Alice's move.\n   - **<missing 5>**: This must be a condition on $n$ after Bob's move.\n   - **<missing 6>**: This must be a condition on $n$ after Alice's subsequent move.\n\n### General Case Analysis:\n3. **<missing 7>**: In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that **<missing 8>**, so we should aim to prove this.\n\n   - **<missing 7>**: This is a general statement about the game lasting indefinitely.\n   - **<missing 8>**: This must be a condition on $n$ related to $a$.\n\n4. **\"If\"**:\n   - Alice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to $n$ if and only if **<missing 9>**. If she does this addition, then **<missing 10>**, keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides $n'$ until **<missing 11>**, Alice will apply the same strategy and keep **<missing 12>**. Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number $n$ on the board such that **<missing 13>**, ensuring there always exists an even number $n$ on the board.\n\n   - **<missing 9>**: This must be a condition on $a$.\n   - **<missing 10>**: This must be a condition on $a$.\n   - **<missing 11>**: This must be a condition on $n$.\n   - **<missing 12>**: This must be a condition on $n$.\n   - **<missing 13>**: This must be a condition on $n'$.\n\n5. **\"Only If\"**:\n   - If $v_2(n) < v_2(a)$ for all $n$ on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of **<missing 14>** for any $n$ on the board. Only Bob can do this, and Bob will subtract $1$ from each **<missing 15>** until they are all equal to $0$ (all odd), ending the game.\n\n   - **<missing 14>**: This must be a condition on $n$.\n   - **<missing 15>**: This must be a condition on $n$.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - We've shown that the game can last indefinitely iff there exists some number $n$ on the board such that **<missing 16>**, and have shown that Alice can ensure the game lasts forever in these scenarios using the above strategy.
