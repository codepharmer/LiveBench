Let's assume it intersects each segment formed by the previous cuts.\n   - The fourth cut intersects all previous cuts, maximizing the number of pieces.\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   - With careful placement, the third and fourth cuts can intersect the maximum number of segments formed by the previous cuts.\n   - The exact number of pieces can be complex to calculate manually, but based on the general formula and the additional constraints, we can estimate the maximum number of pieces.\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the problem, the maximum number of pieces is likely close to the theoretical maximum for 4 cuts, adjusted slightly for the parallel condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter considering the constraints and the potential intersections, the maximum number of pieces is likely to be slightly less than the theoretical maximum of 11. Given the parallel cuts, the most reasonable maximum number of pieces is:\n\n**10**"]}], "tstamp": 1726548889.829462}
