Since Grace tells the truth, Hiroshi lies.\n- The person at the movie theater (Ayaan) says the person at the zoo (Grace) tells the truth. Since Grace tells the truth, Ayaan tells the truth.\n- The person at the movie theater (Ayaan) says the person at the vineyard (Emily) tells the truth. Since Ayaan tells the truth, Emily tells the truth.\n- The person at the art gallery (Luna) says the person at the movie theater (Ayaan) lies. Since Ayaan tells the truth, Luna lies.\n- The person at the cafe (Nadia) says the person at the campground (Ethan) lies. We need to determine if Nadia tells the truth or lies.\n- The person at the airport (Anika) says the person at the movie theater (Ayaan) lies. Since Ayaan tells the truth, Anika lies.\n- The person at the botanical garden (Isabella) says the person at the cafe (Nadia) lies. We need to determine if Isabella tells the truth or lies.\n- The person at the barbershop (Zara) says the person at the cafe (Nadia) tells the truth. We need to determine if Zara tells the truth or lies.\n\nLet's focus on the cafe (Nadia):\n\n- Isabella (botanical garden) says Nadia (cafe) lies.\n- Zara (barbershop) says Nadia (cafe) tells the truth.\n\nSince Isabella and Zara's statements are contradictory, one of them must be lying. Let's check:\n\n- If Isabella (botanical garden) tells the truth, then Nadia (cafe) lies.\n- If Zara (barbershop) tells the truth, then Nadia (cafe) tells the truth.\n\nSince Zara and Isabella's statements are contradictory, and we know that the person at the zoo (Grace) tells the truth and the person at the movie theater (Ayaan) tells the truth, let's use these to determine consistency:\n\n- If Isabella (botanical garden) tells the truth, then Nadia (cafe) lies. This means Zara (barbershop) lies.\n- If Zara (barbershop) tells the truth, then Nadia (cafe) tells the truth. This means Isabella (botanical garden) lies.\n\nSince we need to determine the truthfulness of the person at the cafe (Nadia), the person at the campground (Ethan), and the person at the art gallery (Luna):\n\n- If Nadia (cafe) tells the truth, then Ethan (campground) lies (since Nadia says Ethan lies).\n- If Nadia (cafe) lies, then Ethan (campground) tells the truth.\n- Luna (art gallery) lies (since Ayaan tells the truth and Luna says Ayaan lies).\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\n- **Does the person at the cafe tell the truth?** No (since Isabella tells the truth and says Nadia lies).\n- **Does the person at the campground tell the truth?** Yes (since Nadia lies and says Ethan lies, meaning Ethan tells the truth).\n- **Does the person at the art gallery tell the truth?** No (since Ayaan tells the truth and Luna says Ayaan lies).\n\nThus, the final answer is **no, yes, no**."]}], "tstamp": 1726547694.8852406}
