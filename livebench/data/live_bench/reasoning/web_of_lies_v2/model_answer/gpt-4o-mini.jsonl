If B lies, then the park (P) tells the truth.\n   - However, if we assume the person at the park (P) tells the truth, then the beach (B) must be lying, which is consistent with A telling the truth.\n   - The contradiction arises when we consider the statements from the zoo (Z) and city hall (C). If Z lies, then the botanical garden (BOT) must also be lying about Z telling the truth.\n\n5. **Final Deductions**:\n   - If A tells the truth, then B lies and P tells the truth.\n   - If B lies, then the statements about P must be evaluated, leading to inconsistencies.\n   - The person at the park (P) cannot be telling the truth if both B and Z are lying.\n\nBased on the deductions, we conclude:\n\n- The person at the aquarium (A) **tells the truth**.\n- The person at the beach (B) **does not tell the truth**.\n- The person at the park (P) **does not tell the truth**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**yes, no, no**"]}], "tstamp": 1726547937.9379153}

If Hiroshi is telling the truth, then Kehinde must also be telling the truth. However, if Hiroshi is lying, then Kehinde is lying.\n   - Beatriz (at the museum) says Jaxon (at the ice skating rink) tells the truth. If Beatriz is lying, then Jaxon must be lying.\n   - The person at the museum (Beatriz) also says Hiroshi (at the restaurant) tells the truth. If Beatriz is lying, then Hiroshi is lying too.\n\n3. **Determining Truthfulness**:\n   - If we assume Kehinde (at the farm) is telling the truth, then Hiroshi (at the restaurant) must also be telling the truth, which would make Beatriz (at the museum) a liar because she claims Hiroshi tells the truth.\n   - If Beatriz is lying, then Jaxon (at the ice skating rink) is also lying, which contradicts the assumption that Kehinde is telling the truth.\n   - Therefore, Kehinde must be lying, which means Hiroshi is lying, and consequently, Beatriz must be telling the truth.\n\n4. **Final Conclusions**:\n   - The person at the museum (Beatriz) tells the truth.\n   - The person at the restaurant (Hiroshi) does not tell the truth.\n   - The person at the farm (Kehinde) does not tell the truth.\n\nPutting this all together, the answers are:\n- Does the person at the museum tell the truth? **yes**\n- Does the person at the restaurant tell the truth? **no**\n- Does the person at the farm tell the truth? **no**\n\nThus, the final answer is **yes, no, no**."]}], "tstamp": 1726547943.5512416}
