The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian Army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. Azad tells her to keep it a secret and instructs her to enlist court-martialed soldiers Firoz (Freddy) and Rakesh (Rocky) for the mission. \n\nIn a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. However, they ended up killing him and were court-martialed for not following orders, after which Freddy broke off his engagement with Priya.\n\nMeanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. Pam unlocks the vault and it is revealed that the package is actually a woman named Priya, who was once engaged to Freddy. Since the hard drives were at the risk of being hacked or falling into wrong hands, the codes to a highly advanced defence system named Karan Kavach were encrypted inside Priya's brain. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. \n\nFreddy, Rocky, Misha, and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Amid failed password attempts, Priya awakens and suggests using \u2018Eklavya\u2019, the name of Kabir's own clone. It works and the Karan Kavach is reactivated, averting the airstrike and a potential war. However, the masked man and his army take Priya hostage and following a sustained chase, the group are cornered and the masked man reveals himself as Kabir, a former friend of the duo. \n\nKabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatised and vengeful. He also reveals the nearly immortal masked men were none other than the duo's clones. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Pam suggests destroying them using a high amount of electricity, and the duo kills all the clones by luring them into a power grid, causing them to explode. \n\nJust as the team is cornered and nearly defeated, Freddy arrives and fights off the masked men. However, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees the scene. Azad also arrives in London, but gets shot by the masked villain. Back to the present, Kabir reveals that he has cloned Azad and kills the real one. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. \n\nFreddy and Rocky manage to kill Kabir's henchmen and return to the base where they reveal to the team that since India has never initiated any of the wars it has participated in, Kabir plans to turn Pakistan and China against India by deactivating the Karan Kavach and launching airstrikes against the two countries, eventually causing India's reputation to be tarnished globally. Kabir launches the airstrikes before Freddy and Rocky fight him off and kill him by impaling him on a spear. The team reunites and leaves the base, while Kabir awakens and is revealed to be alive. \n\nMisha chases after him and gets into a fistfight, impaling him with a sharp weapon. Misha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end."]}], "tstamp": 1726435200.8498745}

One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. \n\nInitially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. Benjamin meets his IF, a cartoonish dragon with glasses. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents, and a clown named Calvin. She suddenly realizes that Cal is her own IF, forgotten after the death of her mother. She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. \n\nTalking with her grandmother, she sees a picture of her as a young dancer and recognizes Blossom in the background of the picture. Playing one of her grandmother's records inspires Margaret to dance and she remembers Blossom, instilling Bea with hope. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea decides to test Lewis' idea. Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blue's original kid, Jeremy, now a grown man trying to launch a business. By eating a fresh croissant in front of Jeremy, Bea reminds him of his childhood home above his parents' bakery; Jeremy remembers Blue enough for Blue to give Jeremy the confidence he needs for a business presentation. \n\nFeeling unmotivated, Bea talks with Lewis on the Coney Island pier. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. Some time later, Cal begins reuniting the IFs with their original kids, now grown up. Bea rushes upstairs to Cal, who comforts her. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. She rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. When Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. \n\nThat evening, Bea arrives at Margaret's to find her hastily preparing for a return to the hospital because there's been a complication with her father's treatment. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. Bea and her father return home, where he trips over Keith, his invisible imaginary friend. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her."]}], "tstamp": 1726435042.6819901}

Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich.\n\nThe crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them.\n\nThe crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany.\n\nJorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him.\n\nWeeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus."]}], "tstamp": 1726435111.30494}

Twenty years later, the trio continued to use Ricky Stanicky as their excuse to forego life obligations and avoid getting in trouble. The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed.\n\nDean and JT's boss, Ted Summerhayes (William H.

She calls the number on the screen and connects to a call center that's located in Springfield, Massachusetts, not aware that it's a phishing scam. The call center's manager, Mickey Garnett, cons Eloise out of everything -- including more than $2,000,000 that's in the account of Safe Homes Foundation, a children's charity whose account she manages. Verona learns that Eloise was scammed out of every penny she had.\n\nDevastated by the realization that she got scammed out of so much, Eloise shoots herself in the head. Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise. Adam is quickly cleared when Eloise's death is ruled a suicide because there was no gunshot residue on Adam, and Eloise's fingerprints were the only prints on the gun. Verona apologizes to Adam for her accusation, and she tells him that the FBI cyber-crimes office has told her that the scammer crew that victimized Eloise has been operating for two years, but the FBI hasn't been able to identify any of the scammers.\n\nVerona vows to find the scammers, but Adam, enraged by what happened, decides to hunt down the scammers himself, and make them pay for what they did to Eloise. Upon learning the hard way that Adam is after them, Garnett explains the situation to the crew's ringleader, 28-year-old tech executive Derek Danforth, who runs a Boston-based corporation called Danforth Enterprises. Derek assigns the company's head of security, former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, to find a way to stop Adam.\n\nBut Wallace learns that Adam is a retired member of a classified program called the Beekeepers, whose members are tasked with fighting different forms of corruption, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction. The Beekeepers are so efficient and well-trained that they make the military look like a joke. Wallace realizes that Adam is a man who should be feared by people like Derek. Adam proves to be an unstoppable force, and Derek, Garnett, and the rest of the scammers have no idea what kind of scorched-Earth hell Adam is about to unleash on them."]}], "tstamp": 1726435125.2673223}

He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. Nine years later, directly after major staffing cuts are announced, young BBC Newsnight guest producer Sam McAlister comes across the photo placed next to a Prince Andrew sponsored, young entrepreneurs event article. \n\nSam McAlister left the BBC in 2021 and now teaches negotiation at the London School of Economics. Arriving home, Sam finds her mother, who has been looking after her teenage son Lucas. Working long hours, she does not get to see him often, but she tries to bond with him over a crush he has on a girl and buying him takeout. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother. Her mother gives her a pep talk, reminding her that she was responsible for the story.\n\nPrince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsk believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press. Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. She knows that she is also a single mother, formally worked in banking and has been working for Andrew for seven years. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda agrees to meet and negotiate terms for an interview. \n\nCalled out by a co-worker for being vocally critical of lead presenter Emily Maitlis and for having sensationalist leanings, the programme editor, Esme, has a word with Sam. Both Amanda are criticised for meeting Sam for drinks by Jason and Sam by another journalist. After tea, Sam convinces her to leave the grounds for a drink. The next day, Amanda invites Sam to Buckingham Palace. \n\nSam gets her and Emily a negotiation meeting in Buckingham Palace with Amanda, the Prince and his daughter Beatrice. Including Emily in the dialogue, she tells her she welcomes her innovations, but reminds her they must find a way to work together regardless of the tension. Once Newsnight secures the 'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not include her. \n\nThe televised interview broadcast on 16 November 2019 focuses on Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein and allegations of Andrew's sexual assault of a minor, which Andrew denies on several occasions. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen \u2013 along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat \u2013 is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. \n\nPR representative Jason Stein is consulted, but the prince insists he ended his friendship with Epstein after the mogul's original underage sex scandals had come to light. They hold off until Epstein is suddenly found dead in his cell, and rumours circulate about the men's friendship. Despite not admitting guilt, in early 2022, Prince Andrew settled out of court for \u00a312 million for Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit for alleged sexual assault. Soon afterwards, the Duke chooses to step down from his royal duties."]}], "tstamp": 1726435087.8235269}

Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface.

Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po.\n\nMeanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. On the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered.\n\nBarely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head.\n\nDelivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre.\n\nA montage of details before the end credits reveal the post-operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels."]}], "tstamp": 1726434997.1034977}

However, he is severely injured during a stunt gone wrong and he abandons his career and his girlfriend Jody Moreno, a camerawoman. Eighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a science fiction epic titled Metalstorm, and wants Colt to join the production in Sydney.\n\nGail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with drug dealers, and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already overbudget film's cancelation. Not wanting Jody's directorial debut ruined, Colt starts to track down Tom. He first goes to Tom's apartment where he is \u2018attacked\u2019 by Tom's girlfriend Iggy. He and his longtime friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone at Tom's apartment. They discover a video of an intoxicated Tom accidentally killing his previous stuntman Henry Herrera.\n\nThe henchmen attack Colt and Dan, destroying the phone with shotgun pellets. They are both attacked by people looking for a phone belonging to Tom in Alma's possession. Colt defeats them after an extended chase through Sydney, involving a rubbish truck. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase, though he swims to safety. Meanwhile, as production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States.\n\nInstead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his PA Alma Milan. She gives him a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with hallucinogenic drugs. After getting into a fight with the drug dealer's goons, he visits Tom's hotel room where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. When Colt returns with the police, he finds the body has disappeared.\n\nThe next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set with his goons and the production continues. After arriving on set, Colt learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film being a less-than-subtle attempt at airing her grievances at Colt. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released on news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence.\n\nTogether, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and into confessing while he is wired with a lav mike. He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air. Dan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions.\n\nTom also reveals that he orchestrated both Colt's and Henry's \u2018accidents\u2019 over his resentment of them thinking he's cowardly for not wanting to do his own stunts. He reveals that Gail is framing Colt for the crime using deepfake technology to replace Tom's face with Colt's on the incriminating video. The rest of the crew, led by Dan, hold off his goons.

The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. \n\nWhen police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, the family acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the house. Vanraj reveals that he has hypnotised her through black magic; she will obey every command he gives. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When they refuse, Vanraj cuts the phone lines and torments the family by dictating Janhvi to do strange and cruel things, such as hitting herself, eating dry tea leaves, and attacking her brother. \n\nRealising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. Having had enough and seeing Janhvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Janhvi throws him from the terrace.

With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. This will complete the ritual for him to acquire the power to control anyone at will, as he believes humans do not deserve free will. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. Thus, the girls are freed from his control.\n\nHe mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive.

Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place.\n\nDementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. Furiosa attempts to carjack the Rig and return to the Green Place, but Jack easily thwarts her.

Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe most strongly in the prophecy. Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Now possessing clairvoyance across space and time, Paul sees an adult Alia on water-filled Arrakis. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible futures, and that Jessica is the Baron's daughter.\n\nDue to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his more cunning yet psychotic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and secure his genetic lineage. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit\u2014Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Gurney leads an assault on Arrakeen where he intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban. During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides.\n\nPaul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a duel. Paul executes the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Shaddam surrenders, but the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, so he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Paul's holy war."]}], "tstamp": 1726435012.4561741}

The staff have not been paid their salaries in months, and the three friends, like all the other employees, keep hoping that things will change. Geeta's husband, Arun, runs a struggling food business from home. She has to financially support her unemployed brother, Punnu, and his wife, Sapna, as well. Divya is trained to be a pilot but is forced to take up the job of a flight attendant due to a lack of openings and keeps this hidden from her family as well as struggling to repay her education loan. Jasmine was raised by her maternal grandfather after her parents divorced. She does not believe in relationships, is fond of expensive things, and flaunts a fake and flashy lifestyle on social media.\n\nThe death of senior flight attendant Rajvanshi, while on duty, leads Geeta, Jasmine, and Divya towards a clandestine operation to smuggle gold out of India to the Middle Eastern country, Al Burj. Manoj Mittal, the HR Head of Kohinoor Airlines, is the kingpin of the operation. The three of them become part of the gold smuggling operation and their financial situation soon improves: Geeta funds Arun\u2019s food business, along with helping Punnu and Sapna. Divya repays her education loan fully. Jasmine gets back Nanu\u2019s gold ring from the pawn shop and splurges on herself.\n\nSomeone tips off the customs officials that the three flight attendants are smuggling gold; and even though the three of them hide the stash, the detention that follows makes them feel humiliated and rethink their choice. The enraged customs official, SI Mala, mentions that her tip is accurate which she received from an air hostess within Kohinoor, and cannot come to terms with the fact that she could not recover any gold. Initially, they had thought that their colleague, Komal, would have tipped the customs officer, however, after an emotional outburst by Komal, they realize that she nor their other colleagues tipped the customs.\n\nGeetu realizes that Mittal's wife, Sudha, was also an air hostess and Mala had referred that the tip came from an ex-air hostess; she was the only person who knew about the gold smuggling. They confront her and she reveals that Mittal is cheating on her and to exact revenge, she tipped the customs so that their arrest would also lead to Mittal's arrest. Mittal also returns to Sudha, along with some of the gold he had stashed for himself. However, she further reveals that the real kingpin is actually Walia, who had stolen the airline's money, converted it into gold, and stashed it in Al Burj.\n\nFrom Sudha, they get the address of Mittal in Al Burj and they tail him and eventually find Walia at a luxury hotel where his daughter is getting married. Geeta manages to secure a job in the hotel as a housekeeper and get information about the gold. After a lot of hard work, they hatch a plan where they come to know that Walia and his family are taking the gold in a private jet to the Cayman Islands. Geeta and Jasmine manage to get the role of air hostess of the jet, while Divya becomes the pilot. They spike the drinks of the passengers with sleeping pills and land the plane at Divya's native town, Nanheri, where the police and custom officials are already waiting for them. They, however, manage to keep some gold for themselves and distribute it amongst their friends, colleagues, and loved ones.\n\nThe plane in which the three had hidden the stash is exposed one day when turbulence causes damage to the fuselage and the gold falls out. Vijay Walia, the Chairman of Kohinoor, and Mittal abscond and flee the country as the news comes out.

After the group captures a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor. To appease him, Callie removes underage Phoebe from the team. Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, the ghost of a teenage girl who died in a fire. \n\nMeanwhile, Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian. Wartzki explains the orb was built millennia ago by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army who would use \u2018Kusharit Umoti\u2019 - \u2018the power to kill by fear itself. When he tests its PKE levels, the orb immediately emits broad-spectrum telekinetic energy. Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers. \n\nNadeem Razmaadi visits and sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings inherited from his grandmother. They learn Nadeem's grandmother belonged to the lineage of Firemasters, one of whom prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom Garraka froze to death. A frosty wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is dangerously near capacity. \n\nWinston takes the orb to his privately owned paranormal research center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield.

Traumatized, the remaining three arrive at the Charlottesville WF base.\n\nJoel learns from Lee's British reporter friend Anya that most remaining loyalists have surrendered, leaving D.C. undefended beside fanatical remnants of the armed forces and Secret Service. The trio embeds itself with the WF as they assault Washington, D.C. Advancing through the largely-abandoned building and against the few remaining Secret Service agents, they shoot a negotiator who is requesting the president's safe passage. After the WF breach the White House's fortified perimeter, the presidential limousine attempts to flee but is quickly intercepted and its occupants (which do not include the president) killed. Understanding it to be a distraction, the trio instead heads inside and is followed by a squad of WF soldiers.\n\nDespite the president claiming that victory is close at hand, it is considered only a matter of time before the 'Western Forces' (WF), led by Texas and California, reach Washington, D.C. Joel momentarily stops them to get a quote from the president, who replies, 'Don't let them kill me'. Jessie unemotionally continues into the Oval Office, watching soldiers drag the president from under his desk and prepare to execute him summarily. Satisfied, Joel stops delaying the soldiers; while Jessie photographs WF soldiers killing the president before posing with his corpse. Lee deletes a photo that she took of his body.\n\nFollowing an overnight stop near ongoing fighting, the group documents combat the next day as secessionist militiamen assault a loyalist-held building. Lee recognizes Jessie's potential as a war-photographer and begins to mentor her, while Jessie photographs the militia executing loyalist prisoners. Jessie's nerve and photography skills improve as she becomes desensitized to violence. Lee and Jessie grow closer, trying on clothes at a shop. When Lee has her shoot a downed helicopter, Jessie asks if Lee would photograph Jessie being killed, to which Lee responds, 'What do you think?'. Jessie steps into the line of fire while taking photos, as Lee sees imminent danger, intercedes and takes a fatal gun shot; Jessie photographs Lee's death as she pushes Jessie to safety. Later, Jessie berates herself for being too scared to take photos."]}], "tstamp": 1726435019.4534495}

They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi, tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. Inebriated, high, and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name \u2018Manjummel Boys\u2019 on the rocks within the cave. After etching it on the wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picture and they all regroup.\n\nSubhash, one of the friends, falls into a covered hole in the ground while moving towards them. Initially, everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints, and no help is offered.\n\nFinally, after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. The locals also inform them that the specific area was off-limits to people for a reason and that so far 13 people have fallen into that hole and none were ever recovered, dead or alive.\n\nThough there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. But soon one of the boys, Sixen, hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. The police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. Kuttan is lowered into the hole, but along the way, the rope with which Kuttan is lowered runs out, and police are worried that it is unsafe to go any lower as there might be low oxygen levels, and they are not willing to risk Kuttan\u2019s life as well.\n\nAt 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. 2 years later, Kuttan is awarded the Jeevan Raksha Padak for his actions."]}], "tstamp": 1726435164.7293503}
