The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian Army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. In a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. However, the masked man and his army take Priya hostage and following a sustained chase, the group are cornered and the masked man reveals himself as Kabir, a former friend of the duo. Kabir reveals that he has cloned Azad and kills the real one. However, Kabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatised and vengeful. Meanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. Pam unlocks the vault and it is revealed that the package is actually a woman named Priya, who was once engaged to Freddy. Misha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai who warns her about the same before he gets killed by another masked attacker. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. As the weeks go by, strange things begin to happen on the farm, and Jack becomes convinced that it is haunted. However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. He kidnaps Priya and leaves Freddy and Rocky to die. Freddy, Rocky, Misha and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Amid failed password attempts, Priya awakens and suggests using \u2018Eklavya\u2019, the name of Kabir's own clone. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Just as the team is cornered and nearly defeated, Freddy arrives and fights off the masked men. However, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees the scene. Pam suggests destroying them using a high amount of electricity, and the duo kills all the clones by luring them into a power grid, causing them to explode. However, Kabir launches the airstrikes before Freddy and Rocky fight him off and kill him by impaling him on a spear. The team reunites and leaves the base, while Kabir awakens and is revealed to be alive. It works and the Karan Kavach is reactivated, averting the airstrike and a potential war. The duo manage to kill Kabir's henchmen and return to the base where they reveal to the team that since India has never initiated any of the wars it has participated in, Kabir plans to turn Pakistan and China against India by deactivating the Karan Kavach and launching airstrikes against the two countries, eventually causing India's reputation to be tarnished globally. The film ends with Jack making peace with the ghost, who thanks him for solving the mystery and helping him move on."]}], "tstamp": 1726863127.708831}

Bea and her father return home, where he trips over Keith, his invisible imaginary friend. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. Bea rushes upstairs to Cal, who comforts her. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. Benjamin meets his IF, a cartoonish dragon with glasses. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Bea chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. She suddenly realizes that Cal is her own IF, forgotten after the death of her mother. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father.

As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. The crew takes their position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control. Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole, Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin), in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. The NFT by N8 is made by a self-portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. The team staged a kidnapping for N8, and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen, and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew. As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton in the theft and arrests him. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more than $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it. Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. The film ends with the protagonist releasing the information to the public, leading to the downfall of the corporation and the arrest of its leaders. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship."]}], "tstamp": 1726862980.4146154}

The fire spreads to the neighbor's scarecrow. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank. Dean sets up Ricky to present his game changer idea to Ted for the World River merger. The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party. Dean is depressed, as he is going to lose his job and relationship with Erin once Ricky is proven to be a fraud. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. Erin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky.

The 'Hero of the Week' story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make. With her newfound knowledge, she infiltrates the corporation's headquarters, gathering evidence to expose their crimes. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts.

She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement.

Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. Mae reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide.

He rents some space in a barn owned by retired teacher Eloise Parker, a widow who owns and lives in the house on the property. While they both live alone, the two are friendly with one another -- Clay sees Eloise as the only person who ever took care of him. The call center's manager, Mickey Garnett, cons Eloise out of everything -- including more than $2,000,000 that's in the account of Safe Homes Foundation, a children's charity whose account she manages. Verona learns that Eloise was scammed out of every penny she had. While checking some things on her laptop computer, Eloise sees a warning about two viruses in the system. She calls the number on the screen, and connects to a call center that's located in Springfield, Massachusetts, not aware that it's a phishing scam. Devastated by the realization that she got scammed out of so much, Eloise shoots herself in the head. Adam finds Eloise's body in her house, and he's immediately arrested by Eloise's daughter, Boston-based FBI Special Agent Verona Parker, who hastily accuses Adam of shooting Eloise. Upon learning the hard way that Adam is after them, Garnett explains the situation to the crew's ringleader, 28-year-old tech executive Derek Danforth, who runs a Boston-based corporation called Danforth Enterprises. Derek assigns the company's head of security, former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, to find a way to stop Adam. But Wallace learns that Adam is a retired member of a classified program called the Beekeepers, whose members are tasked with fighting different forms of corruption, operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction. The Beekeepers are so efficient and well-trained that they make the military look like a joke. Adam proves to be an unstoppable force, and Derek, Garnett, and the rest of the scammers have no idea what kind of scorched-Earth hell Adam is about to unleash on them. Adam is quickly cleared when Eloise's death is ruled a suicide because there was no gunshot residue on Adam, and Eloise's fingerprints were the only prints on the gun. Verona apologizes to Adam for her accusation, and she tells him that the FBI cyber-crimes office has told her that the scammer crew that victimized Eloise has been operating for two years, but the FBI hasn't been able to identify any of the scammers. Enraged by what happened, Adam decides to hunt down the scammers himself, and make them pay for what they did to Eloise. Wallace realizes that Adam is a man who should be feared by people like Derek."]}], "tstamp": 1726863006.1403704}

He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. Nine years later, directly after major staffing cuts are announced, young BBC Newsnight guest producer Sam McAlister comes across the photo placed next to a Prince Andrew sponsored, young entrepreneurs event article. Jae gets back to Sam, sharing photos of young girls going in and out of Epstein's Manhattan home. Jae calls to let her know that Epstein is about to be taken into custody by the FBI for child sex trafficking. After informing Esme, Sam rushes to Amanda's home to convince Prince Andrew to give Newsnight a TV interview. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. Sam finds her mother, who has been looking after her teenage son Lucas. Her mother gives her a pep talk, reminding her that she was responsible for the story. Called out by a co-worker for being vocally critical of lead presenter Emily Maitlis and for having sensationalist leanings, the programme editor, Esme, has a word with Sam. Both Amanda and Sam are criticised for meeting for drinks by Jason and Sam by another journalist. The next day, Amanda invites Sam to Buckingham Palace. In the morning, Amanda calls Sam with the interview time. Sam gets her and Emily a negotiation meeting in Buckingham Palace with Amanda, the Prince and his daughter Beatrice. PR representative Jason Stein is consulted, but the prince insists he ended his friendship with Epstein after the mogul's original underage sex scandals had come to light. Despite not admitting guilt, in early 2022, Prince Andrew settled out of court for \u00a312 million for Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit for alleged sexual assault. The televised interview broadcast on 16 November 2019 focuses on Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein and allegations of Andrew's sexual assault of a minor, which Andrew denies on several occasions. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen \u2013 along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat \u2013 is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. Soon afterwards, the Duke chooses to step down from his royal duties. Once Newsnight secures the 'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not include her. Working long hours, she does not get to see him often, but she tries to bond with him over a crush he has on a girl and buying him takeout. Including Emily in the dialogue, she tells her she welcomes her innovations, but reminds her they must find a way to work together regardless of the tension. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother. They hold off until Epstein is suddenly found dead in his cell, and rumours circulate about the men's friendship."]}], "tstamp": 1726862936.7891955}

When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the tribe's lair, and the two slowly bond on their journey. Meanwhile, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as \u2018Titans\u2019 \u2014 killing Titan Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. The signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi's home and the portals. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro, and Shimo induces a second ice age at Skar King's command. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb.

With their supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po. While SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Meanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. On the night of the intended raid, Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Although Luhr eventually catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip', the raid is ultimately successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post-operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels."]}], "tstamp": 1726862820.8805823}

Eighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. Gail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with drug dealers, and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already overbudget film's cancelation. He first goes to Tom's apartment where he is \u2018attacked\u2019 by Tom's girlfriend Iggy. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. Meanwhile, as production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a science fiction epic titled Metalstorm, and wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. Colt starts to track down Tom. He visits Tom's hotel room where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. They discover a video of an intoxicated Tom accidentally killing his previous stuntman Henry Herrera. After getting into a fight with the drug dealer's goons, he retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. The henchmen attack Colt and Dan, destroying the phone with shotgun pellets. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase, though he swims to safety. Dan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions. Tom also reveals that he orchestrated both Colt's and Henry's \u2018accidents\u2019 over his resentment of them thinking he's cowardly for not wanting to do his own stunts. Colt defeats them after an extended chase through Sydney, involving a rubbish truck. He and his longtime friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone at Tom's apartment. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and into confessing while he is wired with a lav mike. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released on news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. The next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set with his goons and the production continues. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom as the lead, and the film eventually becomes a box-office hit.

On a vacation to their farmhouse at a remote hill station, they meet an enigmatic man, Vanraj Kashyap. Vanraj reveals that he has hypnotised her through black magic; she will obey every command he gives. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. Vanraj cuts the phone lines and torments the family by dictating Janhvi to do strange and cruel things, such as hitting herself, eating dry tea leaves, and attacking her brother. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Vanraj arrives at the farmhouse, claiming that his phone's battery has died. Having had enough and seeing Janhvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Janhvi throws him from the terrace. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal. He declares that this is hell now and he is Vanraj's devil. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. This will complete the ritual for him to acquire the power to control anyone at will, as he believes humans do not deserve free will."]}], "tstamp": 1726863052.9717424}

Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. Alin convinces him to take her along. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. Guney and Alin spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Faysal has a private painting collection. Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him. The film ends with the protagonist releasing the information to the public, leading to the downfall of the corporation and the arrest of its leaders.

The last raider delivers Furiosa to Dementus, but Furiosa mortally wounds him before he can reveal the Green Place's location. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. In the final scene, the 'Five Wives' hide in Furiosa's War Rig the night before another supply run. Upon arrival, Furiosa helps Joe plan a 40-day war, during which most of Dementus's horde is killed.

The three of them become part of the gold smuggling operation and their financial situation soon improves: Geeta funds Arun\u2019s food business, along with helping her unemployed brother, Punnu, and his wife, Sapna, as well. The plane in which the three had hidden the stash is exposed one day when turbulence causes damage to the fuselage and the gold falls out. Someone tips off the customs officials that the three flight attendants are smuggling gold; and even though the three of them hide the stash, the detention that follows makes them feel humiliated and rethink their choice. They spike the drinks of the passengers with sleeping pills and land the plane at Divya's native town, Nanheri, where the police and customs officials are already waiting for them. Geeta realizes that Mittal's wife, Sudha, was also an air hostess and Mala had referred that the tip came from an ex-air hostess; she was the only person who knew about the gold smuggling. From Sudha, they get the address of Mittal in Al Burj and they tail him and eventually find Walia at a luxury hotel where his daughter is getting married. Geeta manages to secure a job in the hotel as a housekeeper and get information about the gold. After a lot of hard work, they hatch a plan where they come to know that Walia and his family are taking the gold in a private jet to the Cayman Islands. Geeta and Jasmine manage to get the role of air hostess of the jet, while Divya becomes the pilot. The enraged customs official, SI Mala, mentions that her tip is accurate which she received from an air hostess within Kohinoor, and cannot come to terms with the fact that she could not recover any gold. Mittal also returns to Sudha, along with some of the gold he had stashed for himself. The film ends with Vijay Walia, the Chairman of Kohinoor, and Mittal absconding and fleeing the country as the news comes out. Divya repays her education loan fully. Jasmine gets back Nanu\u2019s gold ring from the pawn shop and splurges on herself. However, she further reveals that the real kingpin is actually Walia, who had stolen the airline's money, converted it into gold, and stashed it in Al Burj."]}], "tstamp": 1726863093.6631062}

Shepherd is assigned to a company of 'Rangers.' She is introduced to an ARC, an AI which Shepherd does not trust because of her past with Harlan. The ARC is provided with a new ARC containing Smith's CPU. Smith tries to convince Shepherd that she must trust it implicitly so they can synchronize their systems and operate as one - combining her analytical skills with its vast database and warehouse of weapons. It tells her its name is Smith and she must wear a link that will connect her brain with its processor. To succeed, Atlas must learn to trust Smith, another AI, despite her innate distrust for it. Atlas uses Harlan's captured number two, Casca, to discover its whereabouts and convinces General Boothe to let her join the mission to capture or destroy it. They travel to Andromeda in the Dhib - a heavily armed ship capable of intergalactic travel which has been equipped with carbon bombs that can destroy anything. It is provided as a means of both attack and defense in battle and offers its operator a great deal of protection. The operator rides within the ARC and together they are a fighting team. As they approach Harlan's headquarters, his forces wipe out the ARC equipped Rangers, leaving only Shepherd and Smith alive. In the ensuing battle, Shepherd relents and gives Smith her complete trust. It is only after this profound decision that the two can sync completely and finally destroy Harlan and his allies.

Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian, explains the orb was built millennia ago by four sorcerers called the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a phantom god who sought to conquer the world with an undead army who would use \u2018Kusharit Umoti\u2019 - \u2018the power to kill by fear itself.' Nadeem Razmaadi visits and sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings inherited from his grandmother. When he tests its PKE levels, the orb immediately emits broad-spectrum telekinetic energy. To learn more, he joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals that the orb was kept hidden by his grandmother within a brass-lined chamber. Winston takes the orb to his privately owned paranormal research center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winston's research center. Phoebe attempts to control her emotions by playing chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, the ghost of a teenage girl who died in a fire. Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife. The Ghostbusters begin pursuing escaped ghosts across New York City. After the group captures a ghost in Hell's Kitchen, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent, threatens to close them down with his authority as mayor. A frosty wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is dangerously near capacity. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to copper alloys combined with fire and lacking his devil horns which augment his powers. Ray suspects it is an apotropaic trap. By controlling Phoebe's disembodied spirit, Garraka forces her physical body to recite the ritual chant. Melody reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. Phoebe reconfigures her proton pack with copper alloys to strengthen it; Melody, betrayed by Garraka, atones by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka. Using an experimental extraction device, Lars is unable to extract any spiritual energy from the orb. Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters, aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers. When the trio attempt to stop a ghost from stealing a phonographic recording of the club's ritual, Peck exploits Phoebe's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. He then escapes, locates his horns, and begins freezing the city. Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. Ray, with help from his fellow veteran Ghostbusters, entraps the god by improvising the ruptured containment unit as a giant trap. The movie ends with the protagonist releasing the information to the public, leading to the downfall of the corporation and the arrest of its leaders. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. In a mid-credits scene, a trucker gets out of his truck to buy something from a vending machine, while the Mini-Pufts steal his vehicle in his absence."]}], "tstamp": 1726862898.9927006}

At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team faces a major defeat against Yugoslavia with a score of 10-1. Meanwhile, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plan to remove Rahim from the federation and make Subhankar the President. The federation removes Rahim as coach for the Indian team on the grounds that the team has failed to give a good performance for a long period of time. Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again and promises that if the team does not win a gold medal, he will not coach any team again in his life. Rahim begins to coach the team again and prepares them for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. The Indian team goes on to win the match with a score of 2-1, winning the gold medal at the Asian Games. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian team prepares to play against Australia. The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify. Rahim agrees to it and decides to take only 16 best players from the team and leave out the rest, including his son Hakim, who had also begun to play for the team. At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange, where they humiliate each other. Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai and requests to let the team participate, explaining its significance. However, the Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate in the competition, given insufficient funds. Subhankar, who is now President, initially refuses but has to give in to his request as the other members of the federation give their votes to let Rahim coach the team, given the even poor performance of the team since the time Rahim was removed as coach. Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players. Rahim then scouts for players from all over India and forms a new team consisting of Tulsidas Balaram from Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj from Hyderabad and P. Thangaraj, the team's goalkeeper is injured before their first match and is replaced by Pradyut Barman, which weakens the team. In their first match, the Indian team is pitted against South Korea and they face defeat, with the teammates blaming one another for their poor performance. On the day of the final match, where the Indian team would play against South Korea, the team bus is attacked by protesters and the military is brought in to provide security for them. Neville goes on to score a hat-trick and the Indian team wins the match with a score of 7-1, leaving the Australian team in shock. As the weeks go by, strange things begin to happen on the farm, and Jack becomes convinced that it is haunted. His wife, Saira, motivates him, telling him to not give up and pursue his dream of leading the Indian team to win a gold medal.

Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. 2 years later Kuttan is awarded the Jeevan Raksha Padak for his actions.
